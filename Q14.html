<br><p>14. Kirchhoff’s Rules
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Junction Rule (Charge Conservation) — Sum of currents entering a junction = sum leaving: ΣI_in = ΣI_out.</p></br>

<br><p>Loop Rule (Energy Conservation) — Sum of potential changes around any closed loop = 0: ΣΔV = 0.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: The junction rule states charge cannot accumulate at a point. The loop rule follows from the conservative nature of the electrostatic field: a charge moving around a loop returns to the same potential.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: For a loop: Σε = ΣIR (accounting for signs: +ε when traversing from - to + terminal, -IR when traversing in current direction).</p></br>

<br><p>Example: Solving a two-loop circuit: assign currents, write junction equation(s), write independent loop equations, solve the system.</p></br>
