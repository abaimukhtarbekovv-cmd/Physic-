<br><p>17. Faraday’s Law and Lenz’s Law
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Faraday’s Law of Induction — Induced emf = -dΦ_B/dt.</p></br>

<br><p>Induced emf (ε) — Voltage generated by changing flux.</p></br>

<br><p>Induced Current — Current driven by induced emf in a closed loop.</p></br>

<br><p>Lenz’s Law — Direction of induced current opposes the change in flux.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: A changing magnetic field induces an electric field (even in empty space). Lenz's Law is a consequence of energy conservation: the induced effects always resist the change causing them.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: ε = - dΦ_B/dt. For N turns: ε = -N dΦ_B/dt.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: Pushing a magnet into a coil induces a current. The current creates a field that repels the magnet (opposing its motion). Work done pushing the magnet is converted to electrical energy.</p></br>
