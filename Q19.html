<br><p>19. Collisions: Elastic and Inelastic
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Collision — An interaction where objects exchange forces and momenta over a short time.</p></br>

<br><p>Elastic Collision — Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.</p></br>

<br><p>Inelastic Collision — Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not (converted to heat, sound, deformation).</p></br>

<br><p>Total Mechanical Energy — Sum of kinetic and potential energies. Conserved only in elastic collisions and conservative systems.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: Momentum conservation is universal for isolated systems. Kinetic energy conservation is a special case (idealized) with no energy loss to non-mechanical forms. Inelastic collisions maximize energy conversion.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: Momentum conservation: m1v1i + m2v2i = m1v1f + m2v2f. For 1D elastic: v1i - v2i = -(v1f - v2f).</p></br>

<br><p>Example: Two billiard balls (nearly elastic). A car crash (highly inelastic). A bouncing ball loses KE each bounce (inelastic with ground).</p></br>
