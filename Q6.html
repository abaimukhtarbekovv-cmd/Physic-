<br><p>6. Magnetic Field. Induction. Biot-Savart Law
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Magnetic Field (B) — A vector field produced by moving charges (currents) and magnets, exerting force on other moving charges.</p></br>

<br><p>Magnetic Induction (B) — Another term for magnetic field strength (measured in Tesla, T).</p></br>

<br><p>Biot-Savart Law — Law giving the field dB produced by a small current element I dl.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: A magnetic field is a fundamental entity, visualized by field lines emerging from N and entering S poles. The Biot-Savart law is the magnetic equivalent of Coulomb's law, allowing calculation of B for any current configuration by integration.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: dB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I dl × r‌) / r². μ₀ is permeability of free space (4π×10⁻⁷ T·m/A).</p></br>

<br><p>Example: Field at the center of a circular loop of radius R: B = (μ₀ I) / (2R). Field of a long straight wire: B = (μ₀ I) / (2πr).</p></br>
