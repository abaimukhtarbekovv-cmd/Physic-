<br><p>8. Work Done by a Spring Force
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Hooke’s Law — F_spring = -kx (restoring force proportional to displacement).</p></br>

<br><p>Spring Constant (k) — Stiffness [N/m].</p></br>

<br><p>Restoring Force — A force that always points toward equilibrium.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: The spring force is a conservative, varying force. Work done against it stores elastic potential energy (U = ½kx²). The negative sign indicates the force opposes displacement.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: W_spring = ∫ (-kx) dx = ½kx_i² - ½kx_f².</p></br>

<br><p>Diagram/Example: Block-spring system: A horizontal spring attached to a block. Graph of F vs. x is a straight line through origin with slope -k. Work to compress from 0 to -A is the area of the triangle: ½kA².</p></br>
