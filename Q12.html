<br><p>12. Boltzmann Distribution and Mean Free Path
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Boltzmann Distribution Law — Gives the probability of a particle having energy E at temperature T: P(E) ∝ exp(-E/kT).</p></br>

<br><p>Distribution of Molecular Speeds — Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for speeds in an ideal gas.</p></br>

<br><p>Mean Free Path (λ) — Average distance a molecule travels between collisions.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: The Boltzmann factor exp(-E/kT) shows that higher energy states are less probable at a given T. The speed distribution shows a spread—not all molecules have the same speed. Mean free path depends on molecule size and gas density.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: Most probable speed: v_p = √(2kT/m). Mean free path: λ = 1/(√2 π d² n), where d=molecular diameter, n=number density.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: In a gas at room T, most molecules have speeds near v_p, but some are much faster or slower. In a vacuum, n is small, so λ is very large.</p></br>
