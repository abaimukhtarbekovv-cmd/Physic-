<br><p>22. Ohm’s Law: Derivation
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Ohm’s Law — For many materials, current I is proportional to voltage V: V = IR.</p></br>

<br><p>Derivation — Links microscopic and macroscopic forms.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: The law states that current density J is proportional to electric field E in a conductor, with resistivity ρ as constant. The integral form V=IR follows for a uniform conductor.</p></br>

<br><p>Derivation & Formulas:</p></br>

<br><p>Differential Form: Start from electron drift velocity v_d = μE (μ=mobility). Current density J = n e v_d = n e μ E. Define conductivity σ = n e μ and resistivity ρ = 1/σ. Thus, J = σE or E = ρJ. This is Ohm's Law in differential form.</p></br>

<br><p>Integral Form: For a uniform conductor of length L, cross-section A, with constant E: V = E L. Current I = J A. Substitute: V = (ρJ) L = ρ (I/A) L = (ρL/A) I. Define resistance R = ρL/A. Thus, V = I R. This is Ohm's Law in integral form.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: A copper wire: given ρ, L, A, you can calculate R and predict I for applied V.</p></br>
