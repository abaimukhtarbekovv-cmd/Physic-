<br><p>2. Materials: Insulators, Conductors, Semiconductors & Curl
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Conductors — Materials with many free charge carriers (e.g., electrons in metals like Cu, Ag). Allow easy current flow.</p></br>

<br><p>Insulators/Dielectrics — Materials with tightly bound electrons, nearly no free carriers (e.g., glass, rubber, plastic). Resist current flow.</p></br>

<br><p>Semiconductors — Materials with intermediate conductivity, controllable by doping/temperature (e.g., Si, Ge). Few free carriers at room T.</p></br>

<br><p>Curl (Rotor) of a Vector Field — A vector operator measuring the field's rotation or circulation at a point.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: Conductivity depends on the energy band gap. In conductors, valence and conduction bands overlap. In insulators, the gap is large (>5 eV). In semiconductors, it's small (~1 eV). The curl of a field (e.g., velocity field in fluid, magnetic field B) quantifies how much and around which axis the field "curls" or circulates. A non-zero curl indicates rotational character.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: Curl in Cartesian coordinates: curl F = ∇ × F = (∂Fz/∂y - ∂Fy/∂z)i + (∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x)j + (∂Fy/∂x - ∂Fx/∂y)k.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: Copper wire (conductor), PVC coating (insulator), silicon chip (semiconductor). A whirlpool has high curl in its velocity field. The magnetic field around a wire has curl proportional to current density (Ampère's law: ∇ × B = μ₀J).</p></br>
