<br><p>1. Motion in One Dimension
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Position (x) — Coordinate specifying location on a line.</p></br>

<br><p>Velocity (v) — Rate of change of position (v = dx/dt); a vector indicating speed and direction.</p></br>

<br><p>Speed — Scalar magnitude of velocity (|v|).</p></br>

<br><p>Instantaneous Velocity/Speed — Value at a specific instant, given by the derivative.</p></br>

<br><p>Acceleration (a) — Rate of change of velocity (a = dv/dt).</p></br>

<br><p>Freely Falling Objects — Objects moving under gravity alone (a = -g, where g ≈ 9.8 m/s²).</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: This framework describes straight-line motion. Velocity is the "rate of motion," acceleration is the "rate of change of rate of motion." Motion diagrams visualize this with dots representing the object's position at equal time intervals—closer dots indicate slower speed.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: v = dx/dt, a = dv/dt = d²x/dt². For constant a: v = v₀ + at, x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at², v² = v₀² + 2aΔx.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: A ball thrown upward: its velocity decreases (v and a opposite) until zero at the peak, then increases downward (v and a same direction). A motion diagram shows dots getting closer together near the top.</p></br>
