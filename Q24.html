<br><p>24. Resistance, Resistivity, EMF
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Resistance (R) — Opposition to current flow: R = V/I [Ohm, Ω].</p></br>

<br><p>Resistivity (ρ) — Intrinsic property of material: R = ρL/A [Ω·m].</p></br>

<br><p>Electromotive Force (EMF, ε) — Energy per unit charge supplied by a source (battery, generator) to drive current; not a force but a voltage.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: Resistivity depends on material and temperature (increases with T for metals). Resistance depends on geometry and resistivity. EMF is the work done by non-electrostatic forces (chemical, mechanical) to separate charge and create potential difference.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: R = ρL/A, V = IR, ε = W/q. For a battery with internal resistance r: V_terminal = ε - Ir.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: A long thin wire has higher R than a short thick one (same material). A 9V battery provides ~9 J of energy per coulomb of charge moved.</p></br>
