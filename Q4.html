<br><p>4. Acceleration: Tangential and Normal
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Tangential Acceleration (aₜ) — Component parallel to velocity; changes speed: aₜ = dv/dt.</p></br>

<br><p>Normal/Centripetal Acceleration (aₙ) — Component perpendicular to velocity, toward curvature center; changes direction: aₙ = v²/ρ (ρ = radius of curvature).</p></br>

<br><p>Total Acceleration (a) — Vector sum: a = aₜ + aₙ. Magnitude: a = √(aₜ² + aₙ²).</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: Any curved or non-uniform motion decomposes acceleration this way. aₜ is due to change in speed; aₙ is due to change in direction. In uniform circular motion, aₜ=0 and aₙ is constant.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas & Graphs: aₜ = d|v|/dt, aₙ = v²/ρ. For circular motion: ρ = r, aₙ = ω²r.</p></br>

<br><p>Graphs: For a car speeding up on a curve: aₜ(t) is constant positive, aₙ(t) increases (since v increases). The vector a points inward and forward.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: A planet in elliptical orbit: aₙ is largest at perihelion (smallest r), aₜ is non-zero except at peri/aphelion.</p></br>
