<br><p>3. Isoprocesses
    Definition/Main Principle: Thermodynamic processes where one state variable (P, V, T) is held constant for an ideal gas.</p></br>
<br><p>Isochoric (V = const)</p></br>
<br><p>Isobaric (P = const)</p></br>
<br><p>Isothermal (T = const)</p></br>
<br><p>Adiabatic (Q = 0, no heat exchange)</p></br>
<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: These are idealized models to study gas behavior. They show how P, V, T interrelate when one is fixed. The corresponding laws are derived from the ideal gas law PV = nRT.</p></br>
<br><p>Relevant Formulas & Graphs:</p></br>
<br><p>Isochoric (Charles' Law): P/T = const. Graph: A vertical line on P-V diagram; a straight line through origin on P-T diagram.</p></br>
<br><p>Isobaric (Gay-Lussac's Law): V/T = const. Graph: A horizontal line on P-V diagram; a straight line through origin on V-T diagram.</p></br>
<br><p>Isothermal (Boyle's Law): PV = const. Graph: A hyperbola on P-V diagram.</p></br>
<br><p>Adiabatic: PV^γ = const, where γ = Cp/Cv. Graph: A steeper curve than an isotherm on P-V diagram.</p></br>
<br><p>Example: A sealed, rigid container heated (isochoric): pressure rises. A piston under constant weight (isobaric): volume expands with heating.</p></br>
