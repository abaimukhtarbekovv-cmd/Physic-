<br><p>23. Electric Field & Superposition Principle
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Electric Field (E) — Force per unit charge: E = F/q [N/C or V/m].</p></br>

<br><p>Superposition Principle — The total electric field at a point is the vector sum of fields from all individual charges.</p></br>

<br><p>Electric Current — Rate of charge flow: I = dQ/dt. Types: Direct (DC) constant in direction/magnitude; Alternating (AC) periodically reverses direction; Quasi-stationary slowly varying AC.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: The electric field is a vector field that exists in space due to charges. Superposition is a fundamental property of linear electromagnetic fields.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: Field of point charge: E = k q/r² * r‌. Superposition: E_total = E₁ + E₂ + ....</p></br>

<br><p>Example: Field midway between equal opposite charges: fields add, pointing from + to -. Household electricity is AC (50/60 Hz).</p></br>
