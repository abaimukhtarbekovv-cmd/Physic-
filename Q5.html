<br><p>5. Newton’s First Law and Inertial Frames
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia) — A body remains at rest or in uniform rectilinear motion unless acted upon by a net external force.</p></br>

<br><p>Inertial Frame of Reference — A reference frame where the first law holds true (non-accelerating).</p></br>

<br><p>Noninertial Frame — An accelerating frame (e.g., rotating or linearly accelerating) where fictitious forces (e.g., centrifugal) appear to explain motion.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: The First Law defines the concept of force as that which disturbs the natural state of inertial motion. It also establishes the need for inertial frames to apply Newton's laws in their simple form. Noninertial frames require adding pseudo-forces to make F=ma work.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: Condition in inertial frame: If ΣF = 0, then a = 0 (or v = constant).</p></br>

<br><p>Example: A book on a car seat: In a cruising car (inertial frame), it stays put. When the car brakes (noninertial frame), the book slides forward as if pushed by a "force."</p></br>
