<br><p>26. Gauss’s Law in Magnetism
    (Note: This is identical to Topic 16, indicating a possible duplication in the list. Answer is provided again for completeness.)</p></br>

<br><p>Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Gauss’s Law for Magnetism — ∮ B·dA = 0 (net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero).</p></br>

<br><p>Magnetic Flux (Φ_B) — Φ_B = ∫ B·dA.</p></br>

<br><p>Area Vector (dA) — Perpendicular to surface.</p></br>

<br><p>Zero Flux Case — B parallel to surface or symmetric cancellation.</p></br>

<br><p>Maximum Flux Case — B uniform and perpendicular to plane of surface.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: This law implies no magnetic monopoles exist. Magnetic field lines are always closed loops; they have no beginning or end. Every line entering a volume must exit it.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: Φ_B = ∫ B·dA, ∮ B·dA = 0.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: For any closed surface around a bar magnet, the number of field lines entering (at S pole) equals those leaving (at N pole), yielding zero net flux.</p></br>
