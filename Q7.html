<br><p>7. Work Done by a Varying Force
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>System and Environment — System: the object of study. Environment: everything else.</p></br>

<br><p>Work (W) — Energy transfer via force; defined as dW = F·dr (dot product).</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: Work is the process of energy transfer. Only the force component parallel to displacement does work. For a varying force, total work is the sum (integral) of infinitesimal works along the path.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: W = ∫_{r_i}^{r_f} F·dr. SI Unit: Joule (J) = N·m.</p></br>

<br><p>Diagram/Example: Graph of F_x(x). The work from x_i to x_f is the area under the curve. Stretching a spring: F = kx, work W = ∫ kx dx = ½kx².</p></br>
