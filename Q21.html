<br><p>21. Kinetic Energy and Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Kinetic Energy (K) — Energy of motion: K = ½mv².</p></br>

<br><p>Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem — Net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy: W_net = ΔK = K_f - K_i.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: Kinetic energy quantifies the work an object can do by being brought to rest. The theorem is an energy-based reformulation of Newton's 2nd Law, connecting the net force's action over a path to the change in speed.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: K = ½mv². W_net = ∫ F_net·dr = ΔK.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: A car braking: friction force (net force) does negative work W = -F_d d, reducing kinetic energy to zero: -F_d d = 0 - ½mv₀².</p></br>
