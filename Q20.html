<br><p>20. Magnetic Moment of a Coil & Field on Axis
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Magnetic Moment (μ) of a current loop — Vector μ = I * A, where A is area vector (direction by right-hand rule: curl fingers along I, thumb gives μ).</p></br>

<br><p>Magnetic Field on Axis of Circular Loop — Field along the perpendicular axis through the loop's center.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: The magnetic moment is a fundamental property of a current loop, determining the torque it experiences in a B-field (τ = μ × B). The field on the axis is symmetrical and decreases with distance.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: μ = N I A (for N turns). Field on axis at distance x from center: B = (μ₀ I R²) / (2(R² + x²)^{3/2}). At the center (x=0): B = (μ₀ I) / (2R).</p></br>

<br><p>Example: A solenoid is many loops; its magnetic moment is μ = N I A. A compass needle aligns with the B-field of a current loop.</p></br>
