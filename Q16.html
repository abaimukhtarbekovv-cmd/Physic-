<br><p>16. Definition of Magnetic Flux
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Magnetic Flux (Φ_B) — Measure of magnetic field lines passing through a surface: Φ_B = ∫ B·dA.</p></br>

<br><p>Area Vector (dA) — Vector perpendicular to surface element, magnitude = area.</p></br>

<br><p>Zero Flux — When B is parallel to the surface or net lines in = lines out.</p></br>

<br><p>Maximum Flux — When B is uniform and perpendicular to the plane of the surface: Φ_B = B*A.</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: Flux quantifies the "amount" of magnetic field penetrating a surface. It is crucial for Faraday's Law of Induction. The dot product means only the perpendicular component of B contributes.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: Φ_B = ∫ B·dA = ∫ B cosθ dA.</p></br>

<br><p>Example: A loop in a uniform B-field: flux is max when plane is perpendicular to B, zero when parallel. For a closed surface, net Φ_B is always zero (Gauss's law for magnetism).</p></br>
