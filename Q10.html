<br><p>10. Coulomb’s Law
    Definition/Main Principle:</p></br>

<br><p>Coulomb’s Law — The electrostatic force between two point charges.</p></br>

<br><p>Electric Force — The force arising from static charges.</p></br>

<br><p>Point Charge — A charged object of negligible size.</p></br>

<br><p>Permittivity of Free Space (ε₀) — Constant: ε₀ ≈ 8.85×10⁻¹² C²/(N·m²).</p></br>

<br><p>Physical Meaning & Explanation: This is the fundamental law of electrostatics. The force is proportional to the product of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance. It is analogous to Newton's law of gravity.</p></br>

<br><p>Relevant Formulas: Magnitude: F = k * |q1 q2| / r², where k = 1/(4πε₀). Vector form: F₁₂ = (k q1 q2 / r²) * r‌₁₂ (force on q1 due to q2).</p></br>

<br><p>Example: Two electrons repel with a force F = k e²/r². This force is ~10⁴² times stronger than their gravitational attraction.</p></br>
